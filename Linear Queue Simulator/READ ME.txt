                        ************


Linear Queue is a C Graphics based simulator for the working of the Linear Queue data structure.This program works well if the graphics directory for the program matches exactly 

i.e. d:\\tcpp


if the graphics directory for the C in the system differs the program needs to be changed as shown below

Just go and check the program for the following line and modify it as 

initgraph(&gd,&gm," ");

here in the double quotes type the path of the graphics directory

eg:

initgraph(&gd,&gm,"d:\\tcpp\\bgi");


then run the program
.
